# 🎮 Core Frontend Games

Interview-level frontend games built using pure **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.

This repository focuses on **core frontend fundamentals** such as DOM manipulation, event handling, state management, and game logic — without using any frameworks or external libraries.

## 🚀 Why This Repository?

Most frontend portfolios rely heavily on frameworks.  
This project intentionally avoids them to demonstrate **strong foundational skills**, which are critical for frontend interviews and real-world debugging.

**No React. No libraries. No shortcuts.**
